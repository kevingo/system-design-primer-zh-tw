## 步驟一：描述使用情境與限制

> 蒐集問題的需求、資訊和範圍。
> 透過詢問問題來瞭解使用情境和限制。
> 討論你的假設。

在這裡沒有面試者會幫你釐清上面的問題，所以我們會預先定義一些使用情境和限制。

### 使用情境

解決這個問題需要透過不斷來回修正的方式：1) **負載壓力測試**、2) **描述瓶頸**、3) 解決瓶頸，並提出替代方案、4) 重複以上步驟。上面這幾個步驟可以很好的幫助你解決可擴展系統架構的基本問題。

除非你本來就對 AWS 有相關背景知識，或是你打算申請的職位需要 AWS 的知識，否則對於 AWS 的細部知識並非必要。然而，**絕大多數在這裡提到的準則，你都可以用在其他非 AWS 的環境上**。

#### 我們將所要解決的問題限縮在以下範圍

* **使用者**會產生讀取和寫入的請求
    * **服務**本身會處理請求、儲存使用者資料並且回傳結果
* **服務**本身需要從服務少量的使用者一路擴展到百萬等級的使用者
    * 我們會討論一個通用性的原則來讓架構本身可以處理大量的使用者請求
* **服務**本身具備高可用 (High-Availability)

### 限制與假設

#### 狀態假設

* 流量並非均勻的分佈
* 資料為關連式
* 從 1 個使用者擴展到數千萬名使用者
    * 我們用以下表示方式來代表使用者不斷增加：
        * Users+
        * Users++
        * Users+++
        * ...
    * 1000 萬名使用者
    * 每月 10 億次寫入
    * 每月 1000 億次讀取
    * 讀寫比例為 100:1
    * 每次寫入大小為 1 KB

#### 計算使用量

**向你的面試人員詢問你是否可以用比較粗略的方式來計算使用量**

* 每月 1 TB 的新資料
    * 每次寫入 1 KB * 每月寫入 10 億次
    * 三年共 36 TB 的新資料
    * 假設大部分的寫入都是新資料，而不是更新既有的資料
* 平均每秒 400 次寫入
* 平均每秒 40,000 次寫入

一些筆記：

* 每月 250 萬秒
* 每秒 1 次請求 = 每月 250 萬次請求
* 每秒 40 次請求 = 每月 1 億次請求
* 每秒 400 次請求 = 每月 10 億 次請求

## 步驟二：進行高階設計

## 步驟三：設計核心元件

> 深入每個核心元件的細節

### 使用情境：使用者發送一個讀取或寫入請求

#### 目標

* 當只有 1 到 2 個使用者時，你只需要基本的架構
    * 只需要一台機器
    * 需要擴展時使用垂直擴展
    * 做好監控來發現瓶頸

#### Start with a single box

* **Web server** on EC2
    * Storage for user data
    * [**MySQL Database**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#sql)

Use **Vertical Scaling**:

* Simply choose a bigger box
* Keep an eye on metrics to determine how to scale up
    * Use basic monitoring to determine bottlenecks: CPU, memory, IO, network, etc
    * CloudWatch, top, nagios, statsd, graphite, etc
* Scaling vertically can get very expensive
* No redundancy/failover

*Trade-offs, alternatives, and additional details:*

* The alternative to **Vertical Scaling** is [**Horizontal scaling**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#horizontal-scaling)

#### Start with SQL, consider NoSQL

The constraints assume there is a need for relational data.  We can start off using a **MySQL Database** on the single box.

*Trade-offs, alternatives, and additional details:*

* See the [Relational database management system (RDBMS)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#relational-database-management-system-rdbms) section
* Discuss reasons to use [SQL or NoSQL](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#sql-or-nosql)

#### Assign a public static IP

* Elastic IPs provide a public endpoint whose IP doesn't change on reboot
* Helps with failover, just point the domain to a new IP

#### Use a DNS

Add a **DNS** such as Route 53 to map the domain to the instance's public IP.

*Trade-offs, alternatives, and additional details:*

* See the [Domain name system](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#domain-name-system) section

#### Secure the web server

* Open up only necessary ports
    * Allow the web server to respond to incoming requests from:
        * 80 for HTTP
        * 443 for HTTPS
        * 22 for SSH to only whitelisted IPs
    * Prevent the web server from initiating outbound connections

*Trade-offs, alternatives, and additional details:*

* See the [Security](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#security) section

## Step 4: Scale the design

> Identify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.

### Users+

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/rrfjMXB.png)

#### Assumptions

Our user count is starting to pick up and the load is increasing on our single box.  Our **Benchmarks/Load Tests** and **Profiling** are pointing to the **MySQL Database** taking up more and more memory and CPU resources, while the user content is filling up disk space.

We've been able to address these issues with **Vertical Scaling** so far.  Unfortunately, this has become quite expensive and it doesn't allow for independent scaling of the **MySQL Database** and **Web Server**.

#### Goals

* Lighten load on the single box and allow for independent scaling
    * Store static content separately in an **Object Store**
    * Move the **MySQL Database** to a separate box
* Disadvantages
    * These changes would increase complexity and would require changes to the **Web Server** to point to the **Object Store** and the **MySQL Database**
    * Additional security measures must be taken to secure the new components
    * AWS costs could also increase, but should be weighed with the costs of managing similar systems on your own

#### Store static content separately

* Consider using a managed **Object Store** like S3 to store static content
    * Highly scalable and reliable
    * Server side encryption
* Move static content to S3
    * User files
    * JS
    * CSS
    * Images
    * Videos

#### Move the MySQL database to a separate box

* Consider using a service like RDS to manage the **MySQL Database**
    * Simple to administer, scale
    * Multiple availability zones
    * Encryption at rest

#### Secure the system

* Encrypt data in transit and at rest
* Use a Virtual Private Cloud
    * Create a public subnet for the single **Web Server** so it can send and receive traffic from the internet
    * Create a private subnet for everything else, preventing outside access
    * Only open ports from whitelisted IPs for each component
* These same patterns should be implemented for new components in the remainder of the exercise

*Trade-offs, alternatives, and additional details:*

* See the [Security](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#security) section

### Users++

#### Assumptions

Our **Benchmarks/Load Tests** and **Profiling** show that our single **Web Server** bottlenecks during peak hours, resulting in slow responses and in some cases, downtime.  As the service matures, we'd also like to move towards higher availability and redundancy.

#### Goals

* The following goals attempt to address the scaling issues with the **Web Server**
    * Based on the **Benchmarks/Load Tests** and **Profiling**, you might only need to implement one or two of these techniques
* Use [**Horizontal Scaling**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#horizontal-scaling) to handle increasing loads and to address single points of failure
    * Add a [**Load Balancer**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#load-balancer) such as Amazon's ELB or HAProxy
        * ELB is highly available
        * If you are configuring your own **Load Balancer**, setting up multiple servers in [active-active](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#active-active) or [active-passive](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#active-passive) in multiple availability zones will improve availability
        * Terminate SSL on the **Load Balancer** to reduce computational load on backend servers and to simplify certificate administration
    * Use multiple **Web Servers** spread out over multiple availability zones
    * Use multiple **MySQL** instances in [**Master-Slave Failover**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#master-slave-replication) mode across multiple availability zones to improve redundancy
* Separate out the **Web Servers** from the [**Application Servers**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#application-layer)
    * Scale and configure both layers independently
    * **Web Servers** can run as a [**Reverse Proxy**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#reverse-proxy-web-server)
    * For example, you can add **Application Servers** handling **Read APIs** while others handle **Write APIs**
* Move static (and some dynamic) content to a [**Content Delivery Network (CDN)**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#content-delivery-network) such as CloudFront to reduce load and latency

*Trade-offs, alternatives, and additional details:*

* See the linked content above for details

### Users+++

**Note:** **Internal Load Balancers** not shown to reduce clutter

#### Assumptions

Our **Benchmarks/Load Tests** and **Profiling** show that we are read-heavy (100:1 with writes) and our database is suffering from poor performance from the high read requests.

#### Goals

* The following goals attempt to address the scaling issues with the **MySQL Database**
    * Based on the **Benchmarks/Load Tests** and **Profiling**, you might only need to implement one or two of these techniques
* Move the following data to a [**Memory Cache**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#cache) such as Elasticache to reduce load and latency:
    * Frequently accessed content from **MySQL**
        * First, try to configure the **MySQL Database** cache to see if that is sufficient to relieve the bottleneck before implementing a **Memory Cache**
    * Session data from the **Web Servers**
        * The **Web Servers** become stateless, allowing for **Autoscaling**
    * Reading 1 MB sequentially from memory takes about 250 microseconds, while reading from SSD takes 4x and from disk takes 80x longer.<sup><a href=https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know>1</a></sup>
* Add [**MySQL Read Replicas**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#master-slave-replication) to reduce load on the write master
* Add more **Web Servers** and **Application Servers** to improve responsiveness

*Trade-offs, alternatives, and additional details:*

* See the linked content above for details

#### Add MySQL read replicas

* In addition to adding and scaling a **Memory Cache**, **MySQL Read Replicas** can also help relieve load on the **MySQL Write Master**
* Add logic to **Web Server** to separate out writes and reads
* Add **Load Balancers** in front of **MySQL Read Replicas** (not pictured to reduce clutter)
* Most services are read-heavy vs write-heavy

*Trade-offs, alternatives, and additional details:*

* See the [Relational database management system (RDBMS)](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#relational-database-management-system-rdbms) section

### Users++++

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/3X8nmdL.png)

#### Assumptions

Our **Benchmarks/Load Tests** and **Profiling** show that our traffic spikes during regular business hours in the U.S. and drop significantly when users leave the office.  We think we can cut costs by automatically spinning up and down servers based on actual load.  We're a small shop so we'd like to automate as much of the DevOps as possible for **Autoscaling** and for the general operations.

#### Goals

* Add **Autoscaling** to provision capacity as needed
    * Keep up with traffic spikes
    * Reduce costs by powering down unused instances
* Automate DevOps
    * Chef, Puppet, Ansible, etc
* Continue monitoring metrics to address bottlenecks
    * **Host level** - Review a single EC2 instance
    * **Aggregate level** - Review load balancer stats
    * **Log analysis** - CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Loggly, Splunk, Sumo
    * **External site performance** - Pingdom or New Relic
    * **Handle notifications and incidents** - PagerDuty
    * **Error Reporting** - Sentry

#### Add autoscaling

* Consider a managed service such as AWS **Autoscaling**
    * Create one group for each **Web Server** and one for each **Application Server** type, place each group in multiple availability zones
    * Set a min and max number of instances
    * Trigger to scale up and down through CloudWatch
        * Simple time of day metric for predictable loads or
        * Metrics over a time period:
            * CPU load
            * Latency
            * Network traffic
            * Custom metric
    * Disadvantages
        * Autoscaling can introduce complexity
        * It could take some time before a system appropriately scales up to meet increased demand, or to scale down when demand drops

### Users+++++

**Note:** **Autoscaling** groups not shown to reduce clutter

#### Assumptions

As the service continues to grow towards the figures outlined in the constraints, we iteratively run **Benchmarks/Load Tests** and **Profiling** to uncover and address new bottlenecks.

#### Goals

We'll continue to address scaling issues due to the problem's constraints:

* If our **MySQL Database** starts to grow too large, we might consider only storing a limited time period of data in the database, while storing the rest in a data warehouse such as Redshift
    * A data warehouse such as Redshift can comfortably handle the constraint of 1 TB of new content per month
* With 40,000 average read requests per second, read traffic for popular content can be addressed by scaling the **Memory Cache**, which is also useful for handling the unevenly distributed traffic and traffic spikes
    * The **SQL Read Replicas** might have trouble handling the cache misses, we'll probably need to employ additional SQL scaling patterns
* 400 average writes per second (with presumably significantly higher peaks) might be tough for a single **SQL Write Master-Slave**, also pointing to a need for additional scaling techniques

SQL scaling patterns include:

* [Federation](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#federation)
* [Sharding](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#sharding)
* [Denormalization](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#denormalization)
* [SQL Tuning](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#sql-tuning)

To further address the high read and write requests, we should also consider moving appropriate data to a [**NoSQL Database**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#nosql) such as DynamoDB.

We can further separate out our [**Application Servers**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#application-layer) to allow for independent scaling.  Batch processes or computations that do not need to be done in real-time can be done [**Asynchronously**](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#asynchronism) with **Queues** and **Workers**:

* For example, in a photo service, the photo upload and the thumbnail creation can be separated:
    * **Client** uploads photo
    * **Application Server** puts a job in a **Queue** such as SQS
    * The **Worker Service** on EC2 or Lambda pulls work off the **Queue** then:
        * Creates a thumbnail
        * Updates a **Database**
        * Stores the thumbnail in the **Object Store**

*Trade-offs, alternatives, and additional details:*

* See the linked content above for details
